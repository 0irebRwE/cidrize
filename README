CIDRIZE

Intelligently take IP addresses, CIDRs, ranges, and wildcard matches to attempt return a valid list of IP addresses that can be worked with. Will automatically fix bad network boundries if it can.

The cidrize() function is the workhorse that does all the work trying to parse IP addresses correctly.

    Input can be several formats:
        192.0.2.18     
        192.0.2.64/26  
        192.0.2.80-192.0.2.85
        192.0.2.170-175
        192.0.2.8[0-5]

Hyphenated ranges do not need to form a CIDR block. Netaddr does most of the heavy lifting for us here.

    Input can NOT be:
        192.0.2.0 0.0.0.255 (hostmask)
        192.0.2.0 255.255.255.0 (netmask)

Does NOT accept network or host mask notation, so don't bother trying.

The module may also be run interactively for debugging purposes.
