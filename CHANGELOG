0.5.2 - 2011-05-17
- Reworked the way bracket parsing works; removed PyParsing as a dependency (too slow)
- Broke hyphenated (4th octect only) parsing into its own function

0.5.1 - 2011-05-03
- Fixed a bug in cidrize() when hostnames were passed in.  Now explicitly checking for hostnames and
  raising an exception.
- Added a test for this.

0.5 - 2011-04-29
- Added a feature to parse a comma-separted input string. New parse_commas() function to do this.
- Modified most parsing methods to accept strict vs. loose parsing except where it doesn't make 
  sense (e.g. CIDR will always be strict).
- Added optimize_network_range() to do exactly that based on a specified usage ratio.

0.4.1 - 2010-09-21
- Re-arranged parsing order inside of cidrize(); will now parse EVERYTHING FIRST.
- Added '0.0.0.0-255.255.255.255' to EVERYTHING

0.4 - 2010-07-15
- Added normalize_address() to cleanup non-standard IP strings (e.g. unicode).
- Added normalize_address to __all__.
- Added netaddr_to_ipy() to turn a list of netaddr objects into IPy objects.
- cidrize() can now translate keywords such as "any" or "internet" into 0.0.0.0/0.
- cidrize() now defaults to loose parsing & will return a spanning CIDR; you may 
  negate this behavior by passing strict=True.

0.3.1 - 2010-05-01
- Added unittests, however weak they may be.

0.3 - 2010-05-01
- Added real argument parsing using optparse.
- Added dump() function for use with verbose output display.
- main() can be imported as easy command-line interface to cidrize functionality.
- Added command-line tool 'cidr' as proof-of-concept for main().
- General cleanup.

0.2 - 2010-02-26
- cidrize() always returns a list upon successful parsing.
- CidrError exception raised on errors by default. (modular=True).
- Exceptions can be silenced and returned as a list of errors (modular=False).
- Added CidrizeError to __all__
- No longer importing * from netaddr/pyparsing.
- Added examples/ipaddr.py which I am using in a web app for strict validation.
- Improved docstrings.
- Implemented setup.py.

0.1 - 2010-02-19
- Initial release
